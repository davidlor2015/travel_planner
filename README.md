## Overview

Travel Planner lets users:

* Register and log in with secure JWT-based authentication
* Create, view, update, and delete trips with destination and date information
* Generate day-by-day itineraries via a local LLM (Ollama) or a rule-based engine using live POI data
* Preview a generated itinerary before saving it, then apply it to the trip record
* View saved itineraries stored relationally (per-day, per-event) in the database
* Track per-trip packing lists and budget expenses, persisted in localStorage
* Browse curated destination cards on an Explore page and launch trip planning directly from a card
* View a gamified traveller profile with stats, earned badges, and destination history

## Architecture

The application follows a clean separation of concerns across three layers:

```

|                                     |
|  Routes -> Services -> Repos -> DB  |
+-----------+--------------+----------+
            |              |
            v              v
     +-----------+   +------------+

     |   :3306   |   |   :11434   |
     +-----------+   +------------+
```

The frontend communicates with the backend exclusively through a REST API. The backend handles all business logic, database access, and LLM communication. The frontend has no direct database or LLM access.

## Backend Design

### Layered Architecture

The backend is organized into four distinct layers, each with a single responsibility:

```
Routes -> Services -> Repositories -> DB
```

**Routes** (`app/api/v1/routes/`) handle HTTP concerns only: parse requests, delegate to services, return responses. No business logic or DB queries live here.

**Services** (`app/services/`) own all business logic. `AuthService` handles registration and login. `TripService` handles CRUD with ownership checks. `ItineraryService` orchestrates the full LLM pipeline and delegates persistence to `ItineraryRepository`.

**Repositories** (`app/repositories/`) are the only layer that writes SQLAlchemy queries. `BaseRepository[T]` provides generic `get_by_id`, `add`, and `delete`. `ItineraryRepository` handles the atomic save of nested `ItineraryDay` and `ItineraryEvent` rows.

**Models** (`app/models/`) contain SQLAlchemy ORM definitions. `ItineraryDay` and `ItineraryEvent` extend the schema with a fully relational itinerary structure.

**Schemas** (`app/schemas/`) are Pydantic v2 models for API request and response. They are separate from ORM models so the API shape and the database shape can evolve independently.

### Rate Limiting

AI generation endpoints (`/v1/ai/plan`, `/v1/ai/plan-smart`) are rate-limited per client IP using `slowapi`. The limit is configured via the `AI_RATE_LIMIT` environment variable (default: `10/minute`). The `/v1/ai/apply` endpoint is intentionally not rate-limited because it is a cheap database write. Exceeded limits return `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`.

### API Versioning

All routes are prefixed with `/v1/`. This allows non-breaking changes under `/v2/` in the future without disrupting existing clients.

### Dependency Injection

FastAPI's `Depends()` system injects shared resources:

```python
SessionDep  = Annotated[Session, Depends(get_db)]
CurrentUser = Annotated[User,    Depends(get_current_user)]
```

Route functions declare what they need. FastAPI handles wiring. Dependencies are swapped in tests without changing production code.

### Data Validation

Pydantic v2 validates all incoming request data. Invalid requests are rejected before reaching route logic. `TripCreate` enforces `end_date >= start_date` via a `@model_validator`. `ItineraryResponse` coerces LLM type mismatches (int costs, string tips) to the expected types before the response reaches the service layer.

## Frontend Design

### Design System

The frontend uses Tailwind CSS v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite`) with a custom theme defined in `index.css` using the `@theme` block. All custom design tokens are declared there and generate standard Tailwind utility classes automatically. No separate `tailwind.config.js` is required.

The visual theme is built around three brand colours, bold Poppins typography, and fully rounded pill-shaped interactive elements:

| Token          | Value    | Usage                            |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `--color-ocean`  | #0077FF  | Primary actions, focus rings     |
| `--color-coral`  | #FF6B6B  | Secondary actions, error states  |
| `--color-sunny`  | #FFD166  | Badges, time indicators          |
| `--font-sans`    | Poppins  | All text, loaded via Google Fonts|

Framer Motion handles all transitions. Spring-based animations (`type: 'spring', bounce: 0.28`) are used consistently across card entrances, tab indicators, and button interactions so the UI feels responsive and energetic rather than mechanical.

### Shared Primitives

To enforce DRY across feature components, reusable UI elements live in `shared/`:

* `shared/ui/FormField.tsx` — label and animated error message wrapper used by every form in the app.
* `shared/ui/inputCls.ts` — shared input className helper (border, focus ring, error state). Kept in its own file so `FormField.tsx` exports only a component and satisfies the Fast Refresh constraint.
* `shared/hooks/useGeocode.ts` — geocodes destination strings via Nominatim. Results are stored in a module-level `Map` so the same city is never fetched twice within a session, and requests are spaced 1.1 s apart to respect Nominatim's rate limit.
* `shared/hooks/useStreamingItinerary.ts` — manages one SSE fetch stream per trip. Parses `token`, `complete`, and `error` events from the server, accumulates raw text for live display, and exposes `start()` / `reset()` per trip ID.

### AppShell

`AppShell` (`src/app/AppShell/`) is the persistent layout wrapper rendered for all authenticated views. It contains:

* A sticky top navigation bar with the app logo
* An animated tab indicator that slides between four tabs — Dashboard, My Trips, Explore, and Profile — using Framer Motion's `layoutId` prop. The pill slides smoothly to the active tab without JavaScript measurement or manual positioning.
* A logout button with hover and tap scale animations

### Feature-Based Structure

The frontend is organized by feature. Each feature owns its components, hooks, and validation schemas:

```
features/
  auth/
    LoginPage/           entrance animation, register/login toggle with AnimatePresence
  dashboard/
    Dashboard.tsx        stat cards with staggered entrance, dual Recharts bar charts
    DestinationsMap.tsx  Leaflet map with one pin per unique destination, OSM tiles
  explore/
    ExplorePage.tsx      16 curated destination cards; search and tag filter; Plan CTA
                         pre-fills CreateTripForm destination and switches tab automatically
  profile/
    useProfileStats.ts   pure useMemo hook — derives stats, 8 badge rules (including
                         localStorage reads for packing/budget badges), traveller title
    ProfilePage.tsx      avatar, 4 stat cards, badge grid (earned/locked), destination pills
  trips/
    TripList/            staggered card list, SSE streaming display, edit modal trigger
    CreateTripForm/      react-hook-form + zod, animated per-field error messages
                         accepts optional defaultDestination prop for Explore handoff
    EditTripModal/       animated modal overlay with prefilled form, PUT /v1/trips/{id}
    ItineraryPanel/      day and event breakdown, apply button
    PackingList/         per-trip checklist persisted in localStorage; coral-accented panel;
                         progress bar, AnimatePresence item enter/exit; usePackingList hook
    BudgetTracker/       per-trip expense tracker persisted in localStorage; sunny-accented;
                         category pills (Food/Transport/Stay/Activities/Other); progress bar
                         transitions ocean → sunny → coral as spend approaches limit;
                         useBudgetTracker hook
    schemas/
      tripSchema.ts      Zod schema mirroring backend TripCreate
```

### Form Validation

`CreateTripForm` uses `react-hook-form` with a `zodResolver` to validate all fields before any network request is made. The Zod schema (`tripSchema.ts`) mirrors the backend `TripCreate` Pydantic model exactly:

* `title` and `destination`: required, max 255 characters
* `start_date` and `end_date`: required ISO date strings
* Cross-field: `end_date >= start_date` (same rule as the backend `@model_validator`)
* `notes`: optional

Validation errors appear inline below each field with an `AnimatePresence` slide-in animation. The `noValidate` attribute disables browser-native validation so Zod is the single source of truth.

### AI Generation — Streaming (AI Plan)

The primary "AI Plan" flow uses Server-Sent Events so tokens appear on screen as the LLM produces them, rather than after a silent 60–120 second wait.

1. The frontend calls `GET /v1/ai/stream/{trip_id}` with an `Authorization: Bearer` header via `fetch()` (not `EventSource`, which does not support custom headers).
2. `useStreamingItinerary` reads the `ReadableStream` body chunk by chunk, assembles SSE messages across chunk boundaries, and dispatches on event type:
   * `token` — appends the raw text to per-trip state; rendered live in a monospace scrollable box inside the trip card.
   * `complete` — sets the validated `Itinerary` object; the card transitions to the preview/apply view.
   * `error` — displays a per-card error banner.
3. A Cancel button aborts the in-flight fetch via `AbortController`.

### AI Generation — Non-Streaming (Smart Plan)

The rule-based "Smart Plan" uses a standard `POST` request with a 3-minute `AbortController` hard timeout. A spinner is shown inside the card while waiting. On completion the result goes through the same preview/apply flow as the streaming path.

### API Layer Separation

All `fetch` calls are isolated in `shared/api/` or `shared/hooks/`. React components never call `fetch` directly.

```
shared/api/auth.ts                -> login(), register()
shared/api/trips.ts               -> getTrips(), createTrip(), updateTrip(), deleteTrip()
shared/api/ai.ts                  -> planItinerarySmart(), applyItinerary()
shared/hooks/useStreamingItinerary -> manages SSE fetch stream for AI Plan
shared/hooks/useGeocode           -> geocodes destination strings for the map
```

## AI Integration

The app supports two independent itinerary generation strategies, both returning the same `ItineraryResponse` shape. The save flow (`/ai/apply`) works identically for both.

### Strategy 1 — LLM (Ollama)

Uses a local Ollama instance running `llama3.2:3b`. No external API keys required.

```
1. Fetch trip from DB         -> verify ownership, get destination/dates
2. Build system prompt        -> set persona, inject JSON schema constraints
3. Build user prompt          -> inject trip details, interests, budget
4. Call Ollama                -> async HTTP POST via httpx
5. Clean response             -> strip markdown code fences if present
6. Parse JSON                 -> json.loads()
7. Validate with Pydantic     -> ItineraryResponse(**parsed_dict)
8. Return structured object   -> guaranteed shape, safe to use
```

### Strategy 2 — Rule-Based (OpenTripMap)

Generates itineraries from real POI data without an LLM. Entirely free, no credit card required.

```
1. Fetch trip from DB         -> verify ownership, get destination/dates
2. Geocode destination        -> Nominatim converts city name to lat/lon (cached 24 h)
3. Map user interests         -> translate keywords to OpenTripMap category kinds
4. Fetch POIs                 -> OpenTripMap radius endpoint (cached 1 h per location+kinds)
5. Score and rank             -> sort by POI rating, deduplicate by name
6. Assemble days              -> slot top N POIs across trip days (max 7 days, 3 per day)
7. Return ItineraryResponse   -> identical shape to LLM output
```

**Caching:** Nominatim responses are cached for 24 hours. OpenTripMap POI lists are cached for 1 hour keyed by `(lat_rounded_3dp, lon_rounded_3dp, kinds)`. Both caches are module-level `TTLCache` instances from `cachetools`.

**Interest keywords** (comma-separated): `food`, `history`, `nature`, `art`, `shopping`, `religion`, `beach`, `sport`, `nightlife`

**Budget values**: `budget`, `moderate`, `luxury`

If no POIs match the requested interest categories, the service automatically retries with the broadest category (`interesting_places`).

### Strategy 3 — Streaming LLM (SSE)

`GET /v1/ai/stream/{trip_id}` runs the same LLM pipeline as Strategy 1 but streams output token by token using FastAPI's `StreamingResponse` with `media_type="text/event-stream"`.

```
1. Fetch trip from DB            -> verify ownership
2. Build prompts                 -> same as Strategy 1
3. Call Ollama (stream=True)     -> OllamaClient.stream_json() reads NDJSON line by line
4. Yield token SSE events        -> one event per non-empty content chunk
5. Assemble full text            -> concatenate all tokens
6. Validate with Pydantic        -> ItineraryResponse(**parsed_dict)
7. Yield complete SSE event      -> validated JSON payload
```

If Ollama raises an error or the JSON is invalid, an `error` SSE event is yielded and the generator returns cleanly. `X-Accel-Buffering: no` is set on the response so nginx proxies do not buffer the stream.

### Two-Step Save Flow

Generation and saving are intentionally separate:

* `GET /v1/ai/stream/{trip_id}` — LLM streaming generation, preview only
* `POST /v1/ai/plan` — LLM generation (non-streaming), preview only
* `POST /v1/ai/plan-smart` — Rule-based generation, preview only
* `POST /v1/ai/apply` — Save any approved itinerary to the trip record

On apply, the itinerary is persisted in two places:

1. **Relational tables** (`itinerary_days`, `itinerary_events`) — the source of truth for structured queries
2. **`trip.description`** — a plain-text and JSON fallback kept for backward compatibility with the frontend parser

## Authentication and Security

### JWT Flow

```
1. User POSTs email + password to /auth/login
2. Server verifies password hash with bcrypt
3. Server issues a signed JWT (HS256, 30 min expiry)
4. Client stores token in localStorage
5. Client sends token as Authorization: Bearer <token> on every request
6. Server validates signature and expiry on protected routes
```

### Password Hashing

Passwords are hashed with bcrypt via `passlib`. A SHA-256 pre-hash step handles bcrypt's 72-byte truncation limit so long passwords are not silently weakened.

### User Isolation

Every trip query filters by both `trip_id` and `current_user.id`. A user cannot read, modify, or delete another user's trips even if they know the trip ID.

### CORS

`CORSMiddleware` is configured with an explicit origin allowlist from `CORS_ORIGINS` (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`). No wildcard origins are used in production configuration.

### Rate Limiting

The two AI generation endpoints are protected by `slowapi` per client IP:

| Endpoint                  | Limit (default)  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `POST /v1/ai/plan`        | 10 requests/min  |
| `POST /v1/ai/plan-smart`  | 10 requests/min  |
| `POST /v1/ai/apply`       | No limit         |

The limit is configurable via the `AI_RATE_LIMIT` environment variable using slowapi's string syntax (e.g. `"20/minute"`, `"100/hour"`).

## Testing Strategy

Tests use `pytest` with the following approach.

### Isolated Test Database

Tests run against an in-memory SQLite database, not the production MySQL instance. Each test gets a fresh transaction that is rolled back after the test. No test data persists and no cleanup code is needed.

### Dependency Override

FastAPI's `dependency_overrides` replaces the production database session with the test session. Application code runs unchanged; only the injected dependency differs.

### Rate Limiter Isolation

An `autouse` fixture calls `limiter._storage.reset()` before and after every test, preventing rate-limit hits in one test from bleeding into the next. The `AI_RATE_LIMIT` environment variable is set to `"3/minute"` in the test environment so rate-limit exhaustion can be triggered with just four requests.

## Software Engineering Practices

### Single Responsibility

Each file and class has one job. Routes handle HTTP. Services handle business logic. Repositories handle database access. Schemas handle validation. `OllamaClient` does one thing: make HTTP calls to Ollama (`generate_json` for batch, `stream_json` for SSE). On the frontend, sub-components like `StatCard`, `FormField`, `PillButton`, and `StreamingDisplay` each handle one concern. Shared hooks (`useGeocode`, `useStreamingItinerary`) own data-fetching logic so components stay pure renderers.

### Separation of Concerns

The API shape (Pydantic schemas) is deliberately separate from the database shape (SQLAlchemy models). The database can change without breaking the API contract, and vice versa. Client-side Zod schemas mirror the backend Pydantic schemas, creating a consistent validation contract across the full stack. On the frontend, business logic lives in custom hooks or handler functions; components are responsible only for rendering.

### Fail-Safe Defaults

* Unauthenticated requests are rejected at the dependency level before reaching route logic
* Invalid data is rejected by Pydantic before reaching the database
* LLM output is validated through Pydantic before being returned to the client
* Client requests to AI endpoints are guarded by a hard 3-minute `AbortController` timeout

### Type Safety

The backend uses Python type annotations throughout. The frontend uses TypeScript with explicit interfaces for all props, state, and API responses. The use of `any` is not permitted. The Zod schema on the frontend is the TypeScript source of truth for form data (`TripFormData = z.infer<typeof tripSchema>`).

### Environment-Based Configuration

All secrets and environment-specific values are loaded from environment variables via `pydantic-settings`. No secrets are hardcoded in application logic. On the frontend, the API base URL is routed through Vite's `import.meta.env`.
